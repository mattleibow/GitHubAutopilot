   ```

3. Run the scripts from the repository root:
   ```powershell
   ./.github/scripts/list-pending-approvals.ps1

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "GitHub CLI is not authenticated"**
- Run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts
- Ensure you have appropriate permissions to access the repository

**Error: "Could not determine current repository"**
- Make sure you're running the script from within a git repository
- Or specify the repository explicitly with `-Repository "owner/repo"`

**Error: "Failed to fetch PR and workflow information"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify repository exists and you have access
- Ensure GitHub CLI is properly configured
