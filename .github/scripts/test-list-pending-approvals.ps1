.SYNOPSIS
    Tests for the list-pending-approvals.ps1 script

.DESCRIPTION
    This script contains unit tests for the workflow approval checking functionality.
    It tests the core logic without requiring actual GitHub API calls.
#>

# Import the main script functions by dot-sourcing (we'll need to extract the functions)
# For now, let's test the logic with mock data
